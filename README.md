This is my first web page project for "the odin project". I am creating a basic recipe website. I will be using git and creating a git repository, then connecting to my local machine. From there I will create a readme file, open in text editor and write what you are reading now. Then I will create an index.html file within the directory, fill out the boilerplate for html. Then I will add an H1 header. Then I will create a new directory within "odin-recipes" and name it recipes. Create a new html file for recipe, import recipe and add a link to the page for the recipe on the web. Add an image of the finished dish underneath the text. Add two more recipes. And that will be my recipe page.
